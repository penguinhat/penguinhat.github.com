<div id="home">
  <p>You have landed on the personal blog for William David Hunt. I don't know why on earth you would bother to be honest, I wouldn't if I was you.</p>

  <p>I am an English software developer who is interested in creating elegant and useful code that solves real problems. I keep meaning to use this site to blog about software development topics that interest me but I never seem to find the time.</p>

  <p>No relation to <a href='http://www.williamhunt.co.uk'>this other William Hunt</a>, although I did buy one of their ties for Â£15 in TKMaxx once. It's a really good tie, although I never wear it anymore.</p>
