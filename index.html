  <p>You have landed on the personal blog for William David Hunt. I am a web developer in Chester, England who is interested in creating elegant and useful code that solves real problems. I currently mainly use Django and Python at work and I use this site to blog about development related topics that interest me.</p>

  <p>No relation to <a href='http://www.williamhunt.co.uk'>this other William Hunt</a>, although I did buy one of their ties for Â£15 in TKMaxx once. It's a really good tie.</p>
