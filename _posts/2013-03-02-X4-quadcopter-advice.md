I'm posting this mainly so that I have a backup copy that doesn't rely on some random web forum. If you have a [Hubsan X4 quadcopter][amazon] and you can't make it go up without it crashing, you probably need to re-calibrate the gyro. In order to do this, just hold the left stick down-right and then alternate between left and right on the right stick. If you do it right, the blue lights will light and the quadcopter will have recalibrated. Thanks to [this thread][source] which I found this on.
